# notebooks

Jupyter notebooks in support of [GBDX stories](gbdxstories.digitalglobe.com) and more.

In order to run these notebooks, you need to install the necessary dependencies and the [Jupyter notebook server](http://jupyter.org/). For most of these notebooks, you also need access to GBDX.

Note: Protogen is a DigitalGlobe internal capability. As of 9/20/2017, it is not available to the public.

If you want to upload a notebook, make sure that all cell output is cleared prior to upload.
